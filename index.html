    <p>Hello my name is Eugene Biwott but people call me Eugene. <br>I am an introvert by nature therefore technology is my natural habitat.<br> I am practising christian and a believer.</p>
    <p>I am a chill, simple person who likes to learn alot.<br> I believe intelligence is what defines us as people of the world. <br> Socializing and nature is what i love when i mostly get out of my technological habitat.</p>
